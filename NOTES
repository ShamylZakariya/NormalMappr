PRESENTLY:
- we don't need the section header on the "Bumpmaps" section - only for the Excluded section.
- the add/remove button falls off the bottom, sometimes. need to constrain max element height to match what we tell the flow layout

TODO:
- need to improve appearance of bumpmap/non-bumpmap divide - maybe through background color?
- finally, inter-section dnd
    - this might not be possible now that I've overridden default DnD behavior on collectionview
    - might still work for when CV is drag source? I could selectively disable batch drop behavior if dragging inside

KNOWN BUGS:
- certain add/remove from batch/exclusion scenarios aren't animated.
- animation only runs when we have BOTH batch and non-batch sections; if one is empty, no section is allocated, and we have no animation

UNKNOWN BUGS:
- plenty!
