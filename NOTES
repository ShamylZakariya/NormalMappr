PRESENTLY:
- make add/remove buttons look good
- make add/remove buttons only appear on hover

TODO:
- need to improve appearance of bumpmap/non-bumpmap divide - maybe through background color?
- finally, inter-section dnd
    - this might not be possible now that I've overridden default DnD behavior on collectionview
    - might still work for when CV is drag source? I could selectively disable batch drop behavior if dragging inside

KNOWN BUGS:

UNKNOWN BUGS:
- plenty!
