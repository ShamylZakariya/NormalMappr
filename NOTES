PRESENTLY:
- the add/remove button falls off the bottom, sometimes. need to constrain max element height to match what we tell the flow layout

TODO:
- finally, inter-section dnd
    - this might not be possible now that I've overridden default DnD behavior on collectionview
    - might still work for when CV is drag source? I could selectively disable batch drop behavior if dragging inside

KNOWN BUGS:
- when batch window is small and excluded items are "offscreen", they don't get the correct alpha applied to them

UNKNOWN BUGS:
- plenty!
