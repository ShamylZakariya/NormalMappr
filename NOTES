PRESENTLY:
- add a toggle on the items in CV to move to bumpmap or move out of bumpmap to non-bumpmap section - I think DnD is not the right solution here for general case usage

TODO:
- need to improve appearance of bumpmap/non-bumpmap divide - maybe through background color?
- finally, inter-section dnd
    - this might not be possible now that I've overridden default DnD behavior on collectionview
    - might still work for when CV is drag source? I could selectively disable batch drop behavior if dragging inside

BUGS:
- animation of item removal has stopped working - likely need to git bisect to track down breakage
