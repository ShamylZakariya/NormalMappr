PRESENTLY:
- need to fix drop target situation - either do it through colleciton view or make a proxy drag target from finder-to-window drag

TODO:
- need to improve appearance of bumpmap/non-bumpmap divide - maybe through background color?
- add a toggle on the items in CV to move to bumpmap or move out of bumpmap to non-bumpmap section - I think DnD is not the right solution here for general case usage
- finally, inter-section dnd
