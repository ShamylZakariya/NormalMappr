Mac OSX 10.6

- Seem to have fixed the crash bugs by switching to GC

- API Deprecations
	FIXED
	
- The icon view no longer seems to support drag and drop -- it DID before under 10.5
	- It seems that the selection indices are ordered 0->N but the computation of the index clicked is N->0
	- FIXED
	
- initiating a drag on an unselected icon doesn't drag it.
	- did this ever work? 
	- IMPLEMENTED, works.

- The initial message on the batch view "Drop files and folders here" is not vertically centered

- Normalmaps are vertically flipped. wtf?
	- Fixed via affine transform
